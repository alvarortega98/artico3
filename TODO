1. Implement runtime library as a kernel module, instead of as user-space code,
   so that multiple applications can use the ARTICo3 infrastructure simultaneously

   Seems "relatively easy" to achieve, the only big issue appears to be
   memory management/copy between user-space variables and DMA memory
   (in the current version, this is achieved by memcpy(malloc(), mmap())
   or memcpy(mmap(), malloc())).

   IDEAS:
       - Use kthreads instead of pthreads
       - Use ioctl() to implement each of the functions in artico3.c

2. Fix register interfaces in HLS-based kernels to force them to use 3
   ports (_i, _o, _o_ap_vld). There is a first approach implemented that
   uses a3reg_init() to perform a dummy read/write transaction.
