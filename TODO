1. Implement runtime library as a kernel module, instead of as user-space code,
   so that multiple applications can use the ARTICo3 infrastructure simultaneously

   Seems "relatively easy" to achieve, the only big issue appears to be
   memory management/copy between user-space variables and DMA memory
   (in the current version, this is achieved by memcpy(malloc(), mmap())
   or memcpy(mmap(), malloc())).

   IDEAS:
       - Use kthreads instead of pthreads
       - Use ioctl() to implement each of the functions in artico3.c


2. Add optional support for ARTICo3 kernel registers in HLS-based accelerators.
   Also, enable actual usage of these ARTICo3 kernel wrapper registers (now they
   are just there, but the template does not generate any interconnection port
   with the user logic).

3. Add kernel module compilation option to a3dk (now it can only be compiled
   using the setup script, which is only fully valid for the Pynq board).

   NOTE: for this, the best approach to keep the modular philosophy of the
         ARTICo3 toolchain, the idea would be to create an additional folder
         with the required files (e.g. tools/_pypack/artico3/scripts/os).

4. Add device tree overlay parsing and compilation option to a3dk (same as
   in the previous point, it is only generated for the Pynq board, and it is
   not valid for Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC devices).

   This modification should entail the automatic generation (via parser) of the
   device tree overlay in plain text, as well as the parsing of the runtime
   library to match the hardcoded hardware address map (this also means that
   additional parsing is required in each export.tcl script, where addresses
   are assigned to both control and data interfaces for the ARTICo3 infrastructure).

   NOTE: for this, the best approach to keep the modular philosophy of the
         ARTICo3 toolchain, the idea would be to create an additional folder
         with the required files (e.g. tools/_pypack/artico3/scripts/os).
