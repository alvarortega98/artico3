Adding New FPGA Device
======================

This is a short manual on how to add custom FPGA parts to be used with
the ARTICo3 toolchain.


Requirements
============

In order to add a new FPGA device to the list of devices already supported
by the ARTICo3 toolchain, developers need to follow two steps:

    1. Add a new dictionary entry in tools/_pypack/artico3/devices.py

        # xc7z020 (Pynq, ZedBoard, MicroZed)
        dev = {}
        dev["slots"] = 4
        dev["pipe_depth"] = 3
        dev["clk_buffer"] = "horizontal"
        dev["rst_buffer"] = "global"
        fpgas["xc7z020"] = dev

    2. Add a new low-level constraints file in templates/artico3_devices
       with (templates/artico3_devices/xc7z020.xdc can be used as an
       example).

    NOTE: the name of the file has to be exactly the same as the one used
          in the dictionary entry.
