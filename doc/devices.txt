Adding New FPGA Device
======================

:Author: Alfonso Rodriguez <alfonso.rodriguezm@upm.es>

This is a short manual on how to add custom FPGA parts to be used with
the ARTICo3 toolchain.


Requirements
============

In order to add a new FPGA device to the list of devices already supported
by the ARTICo3 toolchain, developers need to follow two steps:

    1. Add a new dictionary entry in tools/_pypack/artico3/devices.py

        # xc7z020 (Pynq, ZedBoard, MicroZed)
        dev = {}
        dev["slots"] = 4
        dev["pipe_depth"] = 3
        dev["clk_buffer"] = "horizontal"
        dev["rst_buffer"] = "global"
        fpgas["xc7z020"] = dev

    2. Add a new low-level constraints file in templates/artico3_devices
       with (templates/artico3_devices/xc7z020.xdc can be used as an
       example).

    NOTE: the name of the file has to be exactly the same as the one used
          in the dictionary entry.

    3. Create a new reference design:

        templates/ref_<os>_<board>_<revision>_<name>_vivado_<version>
        |--- pcores
        |    |--- artico3_shuffler_v1_00_a
        |    |    |--- (...)
        |    |
        |    |--- (...)
        |
        |--- <a3<generate_for_SOURCES>a3>
        |--- build.tcl
        |--- clean.tcl
        |--- create_ip_library.tcl
        |--- export.tcl
        |--- (...)

    NOTE: the folder pcores contains the required IP blocks to be used in
          Vivado IP integrator. The usual approach is to generate symlinks
          to the elements in lib/pcores. In the previous hierarchy, the
          internal contents of the artico3_shuffler_v1_00_a folder have
          been removed for the sake of readability.

    NOTE: <a3<generate_for_SOURCES>a3> is an empty file that is used by
          the ARTICo3 Developmnent Kit parser to copy all required files
          (in this case, the specific low-level constraints file found
          in templates/artico3_devices).
