Adding New FPGA Device
======================

This is a short manual on how to add custom FPGA parts to be used with
the ARTICo3 toolchain.


Requirements
============

In order to add a new FPGA device to the list of devices already supported
by the ARTICo3 toolchain, developers need to follow these steps:

    1. Create a new reference design:

           templates/ref_<os>_<board>_<revision>_<name>_vivado_<version>
           |--- pcores
           |    |--- artico3_shuffler_v1_00_a
           |    |    |--- (...)
           |    |
           |    |--- (...)
           |
           |--- artico3.cfg
           |--- build.tcl
           |--- clean.tcl
           |--- create_ip_library.tcl
           |--- export.tcl
           |--- (...)

    NOTE: the folder pcores contains the required IP blocks to be used in
          Vivado IP integrator. The usual approach is to generate symlinks
          to the elements in lib/pcores. In the previous hierarchy, the
          internal contents of the artico3_shuffler_v1_00_a folder have
          been removed for the sake of readability.

    2. Write ARTICo3 infrastructure configuration in artico3.cfg

        Slots     - number of reconfigurable slots available in this device

        PipeDepth - number of pipeline stages in the ARTICo3 infrastructure
                    (between Shuffler and accelerators, used to avoid timing
                    issues).

        ClkBuffer - type of hardware primitive to use as clock buffers
                        none       (disables clock gating features)
                        global     (use global FPGA buffers)
                        horizontal (use local buffers per clock region)

        RstBuffer - type of hardware primitive to use as reset buffers
                        none
                        global     (use global FPGA buffers)
                        horizontal (use local buffers per clock region)
