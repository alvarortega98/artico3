ARTICo3 Development Kit (a3dk)
==============================

:Author: Alfonso Rodriguez <alfonso.rodriguezm@upm.es>

This is a quick reference on the ARTICo3 toolchain used to generate and
build ARTICo3-based systems.


Project Specification
=====================

* ARTICo3 projects need to show the following structure:

      <project_name>
      |--- build.cfg
      |--- src
           |--- application
           |    |--- main.c
           |    |--- (...)
           |
           |--- a3_<kernel_0_name>
           |    |--- hls
           |    |    |--- <kernel_0_name>.cpp
           |    |    |--- (...)
           |    |
           |    |--- vhdl
           |         |--- <kernel_0_name>.vhd
           |         |--- (...)
           |
           |--- (...)
           |
           |--- a3_<kernel_n_name>
                |--- hls
                |    |--- <kernel_n_name>.cpp
                |    |--- (...)
                |
                |--- vhdl
                     |--- <kernel_n_name>.vhd
                     |--- (...)

* The file build.cfg contains all the required data to generate the
  target system.

* Check demos/addvector for a detailed example on both the directory
  structure and the configuration file (build.cfg).


Launch Instructions
===================

The ARTICo3 Development Kit suite has to be launched in the same directory
the build.cfg file is. The following commands can be used to launch it:

    1.  Set up environment
            source $PATH_TO_A3_REPO/tools/settings.sh
            cd $PATH_TO_PROJ/<project_name>

    2a. Launch ARTICo3 Development Kit
            a3dk

    2b. Run specific ARTICo3 Development Kit command
            a3dk <command>


Hardware System Generation
==========================

ARTICo3 Development Kit> info
    Provides information on the current project.

ARTICo3 Development Kit> export_hw
    Generates Vivado IP Integrator block design for the current system.

ARTICo3 Development Kit> build_hw
    Generates bitstream for current system (requires export_hw).

ARTICo3 Development Kit> clean_hw
    Cleans output products from hardware generation.


Software Application
====================

ARTICo3 Development Kit> info
    Provides information on the current project.

ARTICo3 Development Kit> export_sw
    Generates directory structrure and required Makefile to build the
    current system.

ARTICo3 Development Kit> build_sw
    Builds software application for the current system.

ARTICo3 Development Kit> clean_sw
    Cleans output products from software compilation.


Further Help
============

All commands have built-in help that can be activated passing the -h or
--help argument in the command line.
