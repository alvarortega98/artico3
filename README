ARTICo3 Primer
==============

ARTICo3 is a reconfigurable computing architecture based on multiple
hardware acceleration, and able to provide dynamic and adaptive behavior
at runtime by trading off between its three main pillars (*):
    - Computing Performance
    - Energy Consumption
    - Fault Tolerance

ARTICo3 uses slot-based Dynamic and Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to
provide module replication, a feature that is combined with a configurable
datapath to support different data transfer patterns (SIMD-like execution,
nMR redundant execution).

This repository contains the ARTICo3 framework, which consists of the
basic hardware infrastructure (VHDL IP cores), as well as the runtime
API used to execute user applications with explicit task- and data-level
parallelism under Linux.

Users can found more information on the different development stages in
the doc/ folder.


(*) ARTICo3 stands for Reconfigurable Architecture to enable Intelligent
Management of Computing performance, energy Consumption and Dependability
(in Spanish, "Arquitectura Reconfigurable para el Tratamiento Inteligente
de CÃ³mputo, Consumo y Confiafilidad").
